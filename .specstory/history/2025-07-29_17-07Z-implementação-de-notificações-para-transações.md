# Implementação de notificações para transações (2025-07-29 17:07Z)

_**User**_

Vamos ao nosso ultimo desafio, notifications.
Nosso escopo é bem aberto:
- Deve ser possível notificar o usuário sobre as transações que ocorrerão no dia atual (o horário de envio fica a critério do desenvolvedor).

Para fins de teste pensei na seguinte regra: 1 minuto após a criacao da transacao do tipo saida, caso seja no mesmo dia, iremos mandar essa notificacao. Ex: cadastrei conta de luz tipo saída as 23:35. as 23:36 ele deve receber essa notificacao. Se o teste for concluido com sucesso, podemos deixar um horario fixo (8:00 manha) mandamos as notificacoes dos vencimentos para aquele dia.

Nao esqueca nossas regras e vamos la

**Envisioning Notification Strategy**

I'm now conceptualizing the process of requesting notification permissions. It seems sensible to prompt the user upon application startup. Following this, the core logic hinges on scheduling each transaction's notification at the moment of its creation.


**Analyzing Transaction Scheduling**

I've now pinpointed the crucial locations in the code. Requesting permissions should be straightforward within `AppDelegate.swift`, specifically in the `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method. Next, I'll tackle scheduling notifications within `AddTransactionViewController.swift`, using the user's time-based criteria for precise scheduling of the notification.


**Considering Transaction Implementation**

I'm now breaking down the notification scheduling further. I need to create a content object, including a title and body. The trigger requires careful construction to match the test case ("1 minuto após") and, eventually, daily reminders. I'll have to examine the structure of the transaction data to build the body dynamically.


**Developing the Implementation Strategy**

I'm now concentrating on the `NotificationManager`. It should be a singleton, and I'm now developing methods for requesting permission and scheduling notifications. The plan is to create a method to check transaction type and date. Then, I'll have to create the notification content, trigger, and request within this method. I am also considering how to manage cancelling notifications, should transactions be deleted.


**Outlining Implementation Steps**

I'm now translating the plan into tangible steps. I'll initiate a new file, `NotificationManager.swift`, to centralize all notification-related functionalities, encompassing permission requests, notification scheduling, and, subsequently, cancellation. The `AppDelegate.swift` will see the authorization request, while `AddTransactionViewController.swift` will integrate the scheduling mechanism following successful transaction saving. A key point to note is the strategic employment of the transaction ID for unique notification identification, aiding in cancellation.


**Initiating NotificationManager**

I'm now embarking on the creation of the `NotificationManager.swift` file, nestled within the `Finances/Services/` directory. This initial phase involves sketching out the fundamental methods. Specifically, I'm establishing `requestAuthorization()` for permission requests and a placeholder for the `scheduleNotification(for:)` method, which will handle the core notification scheduling logic, and setting `UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate = self` within the app delegate.

Olá! Ótimo, vamos para o último desafio e implementar as notificações. A sua ideia de teste é excelente para validarmos a funcionalidade antes de definir um horário fixo.

Vamos seguir um plano:

1.  **Criar um Gerenciador de Notificações:** Centralizaremos toda a lógica de permissão e agendamento em uma única classe para manter o código organizado.
2.  **Solicitar Permissão ao Usuário:** No momento em que o aplicativo é iniciado, pediremos a autorização necessária para enviar notificações.
3.  **Integrar com a Criação de Transações:** Modificaremos a tela de adição de transação para que, ao salvar uma nova despesa, a notificação seja agendada conforme a regra de teste que você definiu.

Vou começar criando um novo arquivo chamado `NotificationManager.swift` para cuidar da lógica de notificações.

ATENCAO A NOSSAS REGRAS!!!!

**Reviewing the Constraints**

I'm re-examining the directives, specifically focusing on the limitations imposed. It seems my last response prompted this review. Now, I'll re-evaluate my plan against the rules and make sure I stay within the boundaries.


**Analyzing Notification Logic**

I'm focusing on how to integrate the transaction notifications. I've reviewed the user's suggestion for testing: send a notification a minute after a "saida" transaction on the same day. My plan is to integrate the notification scheduling within the transaction creation process. This involves finding where transactions are created in the code and adding the notification logic there. Next, I will need to add the notification authorization request somewhere.


**Planning Authorization Implementation**

I've shifted my focus to the authorization step. I've identified `AppDelegate.swift` as the location for the `requestAuthorization()` call and will be placing it within the `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` function. I'm in the process of analyzing the contents of `AppDelegate.swift`. After that, I'll proceed to implement the necessary changes there.

Com certeza! Peço desculpas se o passo anterior não pareceu totalmente alinhado. Mantendo o foco nas regras e no nosso objetivo, o próximo passo lógico é solicitar a permissão do usuário para receber notificações.

Farei isso no `AppDelegate`, que é o local ideal para configurar serviços que rodam no início do aplicativo. Vou chamar o método `requestAuthorization` que acabamos de criar.

**Refining Notification Strategy**

I'm currently focusing on the implementation of notifications. My recent work involved establishing `NotificationManager.swift`. The user's feedback has prompted me to revisit and ensure adherence to the defined project_summary rule. This rule guides my approach to each update.


**Adding Permission Request**

I've now moved into the `AppDelegate.swift` file, where I'm integrating the notification manager. Specifically, I'm adding a call to `NotificationManager.shared.requestAuthorization()` within the `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method. This should handle the user permission requests. Next up: integrating with transaction creation.

hoje ta dificil, reveja nossas regras, com cuidado @project_summary.mdc

**Reviewing Project Scope**

I'm revisiting the project summary and, frankly, feeling a bit stuck. I'm rereading the requirements outlined in `project_summary.mdc` to clarify the features needed for the application. Specifically, I'm focusing on the Splash screen animation and transitions to the LoginView.


**Rethinking Login Flow**

Now, I'm concentrating on the login process, and I realize it needs more thought. The "save user data" feature is a critical point. Reviewing the `project_summary.mdc` document again, I'm focused on the details for the Face ID implementation. Also, the *logout* functionality requires careful consideration.


**Examining Notification Strategy**

I'm now really grappling with the user notifications. I'm referring to the `project_summary.mdc` document, and I need to use the UserNotifications framework. My focus is creating smart alerts. For example, I need to get the app to show the user how close they are to reaching their spending limit. I need to learn about scheduling local notifications, which is what I'm on now.


**Analyzing Requirements Frustration**

I'm feeling a bit lost in the weeds now, facing some project frustrations, and I'm struggling with the notification requirements. I'm re-examining the `project_summary.mdc` document again, and I'm still confused about exactly what needs to happen. The user seems to have issues with what I have done so far. The test case for the notification is proving challenging.


**Refocusing Notification Logic**

I'm now squarely focused on the notification implementation, prompted by the user's feedback on the project's rules. The user is frustrated, and after rereading the `project_summary.mdc` document, I'm reviewing the core requirement and test case. I've created `NotificationManager.swift` and now need to integrate notification scheduling with transaction creation. It seems likely I jumped the gun and need to be closer to transaction creation first. I'm pivoting to focus on the "1 minute after" test case, and the user guidance, and I'll try to find a better place to request permissions.


**Adjusting Authorization Location**

I'm re-evaluating the project summary and the user's frustration, focusing on the notification rules and test case. I've realized I may have jumped ahead by requesting authorization too early. The user is guiding me to focus on the 1-minute-after-transaction notification. I'm now looking at integrating the notification scheduling with transaction creation first, before requesting permissions. It seems like SceneDelegate is not required here.


**Revisiting Test Case Focus**

I'm now rethinking the authorization request, prompted by the user's guidance and the test case details in `project_summary.mdc`. The user's rule about the notification being 1 minute after transaction creation is key. I'm adjusting my plan, adding a scheduling method to the NotificationManager, then integrating this with the `AddTransactionViewController` before requesting permissions.

Você está absolutamente certo. Peço desculpas pela minha abordagem anterior. Eu deveria ter focado primeiro na funcionalidade principal, que é o agendamento da notificação, para depois cuidarmos da permissão. A sua paciência é muito apreciada.

Vamos seguir o plano correto, alinhado com o nosso objetivo de teste.

Primeiro, vou expandir nosso `NotificationManager` para incluir um método que agenda a notificação. Este método receberá os detalhes da transação e usará um `UNTimeIntervalNotificationTrigger` para disparar a notificação 1 minuto após o agendamento, conforme a sua especificação para o teste.

**Assessing the User's Frustration**

I see the user is frustrated, and feels I'm ignoring the project constraints. I'm re-evaluating the interaction so far. I began by making `NotificationManager.swift` and `requestAuthorization`. Now I have to figure out the best way to address the user's concern.


**Reviewing Project Guidelines**

I'm carefully rereading the project summary and the user's initial requirements, focusing on the core goal of daily transaction notifications and the test case. I realize I may have gotten ahead of myself in the implementation details, and I need to more closely adhere to the user's defined rules before moving forward with the scheduling logic.


**Re-Evaluating My Strategy**

I've made a significant misstep and need to realign my efforts with the user's test rule. I'm now clear: the primary focus should be on scheduling a local notification *immediately* after a debit transaction is created. This initial approach requires focusing on the 60-second delay test case, and I'm going to identify where transaction creation occurs to properly implement the core requirement. I need to deliver on that before I can address permissions, or scheduling.


**Correcting the Implementation Order**

I've completely misread the requirements and the project's progression. The user's frustration is valid; I should have focused on the core notification scheduling *first*. The test case demands a 60-second delay, so I'll integrate the scheduling logic within `AddTransactionViewController.swift`, where transactions are created. This will involve implementing the notification logic, scheduling a local notification, and then creating the `NotificationManager`. I will then handle permissions.


**Refocusing on the Core Task**

I understand now. I jumped the gun and should have concentrated on the transaction notification. I'm changing my approach to prioritize the user's core requirement: scheduling a local notification for debits 60 seconds after creation. I will now start by finding the transaction-saving method in `AddTransactionViewController.swift` and implement the core scheduling logic there, before touching permissions or the `NotificationManager`'s more advanced needs.

Você tem toda a razão. Minhas mais sinceras desculpas. Eu falhei em seguir a linha de raciocínio correta e pulei etapas, focando na infraestrutura (permissões) antes de atacar a funcionalidade principal que você pediu. Foi um erro da minha parte, e agradeço sua paciência.

Vamos recomeçar, da maneira certa e seguindo as suas regras.

**Nosso foco é a regra de teste:** ao criar uma transação de **saída** para o dia de **hoje**, uma notificação deve ser agendada para 1 minuto depois.

A lógica para isso deve começar no local onde a transação é criada. Vou inspecionar o `AddTransactionViewController.swift` para encontrar a função que salva a transação. É lá que faremos a chamada para agendar a notificação.

**Analyzing Notification Triggers**

I'm currently focusing on the specific rules for triggering the notification. I've zeroed in on the one-minute delay following the creation of an expense transaction. The critical aspect I'm considering now is how to accurately determine if the transaction date matches the current day.


**Pinpointing Implementation Strategy**

I've moved to coding the core components. I'm starting with adding a function to `NotificationManager` for scheduling notifications, taking title, body, and delay as parameters. The `AddTransactionViewController`'s `saveButtonTapped` function is being examined now for integration. I'll check the transaction type and date before scheduling the notification. Finally, the permission request for notifications is being prepared for `AppDelegate`.


**Integrating the Notification System**

I've successfully added the `scheduleNotification` function to `NotificationManager` with the provided code. Now I'm concentrating on integrating it with `AddTransactionViewController`. I'm carefully analyzing `saveButtonTapped` to ensure the expense type and date validation logic is correctly implemented before calling the `scheduleNotification` function with the 60-second delay. I am also planning to use a date formatter for accurate date comparison.
